### 👋 Hi there, I'm Christopher Strand 
I’m a student in **Applied Robotics** at the **Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU)**, specializing in **Programming, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision**.  


🚗 I’m currently working on projects related to **image analysis**, **autonomous systems**, and **machine learning**.  
👨🏻‍🏫 I also work as a **teaching assistant** in *INF250 – Image Signal Processing and Computer Vision*.  


📚 This semester I’m taking:  
- **DAT300** – Applied Deep Learning  
- **INF230** – Databases  

  
🎯 I’m especially interested in combining **machine learning, data analysis, robotics, and computer vision** to create practical, real-world solutions.
